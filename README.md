# About
This project contains a theme for statically generated sites using a [Statiq.dev](https://statiq.dev) framework. It is based on the
original [Beluga Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/themes/beluga/) theme. Some elements of the original theme have been
removed or rewritten. Mainly the search component is abandoned since it cannot be fully supported on static sites anyway.
